    <h4>Maggi noodles are a popular brand of instant noodles produced by Nestl√©. 
        Known for their quick preparation and distinctive masala seasoning, they 
        are a staple comfort food in many households, especially in India, 
        Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa. Each packet typically contains a 
        block of dried noodles and a seasoning sachet, which is often a blend 
        of spices, salt, and flavor enhancers. Maggi noodles can be cooked in 
        just a few minutes by boiling them in water with the seasoning mix, 
        making them a convenient and affordable meal option.</h4>
