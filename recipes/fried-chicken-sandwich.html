    <h4><strong><u>Description</u></strong></h4>
    <p>A fried chicken sandwich is a crispy, flavorful, and satisfying dish 
        featuring a golden-brown, deep-fried chicken fillet served between a 
        soft bun. The chicken is typically marinated in buttermilk for 
        tenderness, coated in a seasoned flour or batter, and fried to a 
        crispy perfection. The sandwich is often complemented with crisp 
        lettuce, pickles, mayonnaise, or a spicy sauce, adding layers of 
        texture and flavor. Variations include spicy chicken sandwiches, 
        Nashville hot chicken, or honey butter chicken. It's a popular 
        fast-food and homemade favorite, balancing crunch, juiciness, and bold 
        seasoning in every bite!</p>
